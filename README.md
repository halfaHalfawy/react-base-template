# react-challenge-base-tmp
Yet another reactjs boilerplate
<br>
This is a simple project base to start developing react app with tailwindcss and redux
- Auth, languages services
- Basic login/register implementation
- Smooth animations using react-dom and motion framer
- Clean structure with RTK query api templates and validation and more stuf

Too lazy to write anymore :) guess you will have to figure out the rest and see the preview in the <a href="https://kemorave.github.io/react-challenge-base-tmp/"> link <a>
